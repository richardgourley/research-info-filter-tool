# RESEARCH INFO FILTER TOOL
A tool for researchers written in python. A researcher enters a research topic name and then is asked to enter multiple blog post urls and is then presented with each paragraph from each blog post, where they can choose to keep or discard each paragraph.  Each kept paragraph is saved in a master file of useful paragraphs.
